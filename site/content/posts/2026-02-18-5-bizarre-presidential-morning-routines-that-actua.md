## What Happened

A new compilation reveals the most bizarre morning routines of five U.S. presidents, each stranger than the last. These aren't urban legends or political gossip—they're well-documented historical facts that showcase the eccentric personal habits of America's commanders-in-chief.

**John Quincy Adams (1825-1829)** started each day at 5:00 a.m. with a skinny-dip in the Potomac River, believing the cold water gave him mental clarity for the day ahead. The sixth president continued this ritual even after leaving office. His habit became so well-known that journalist Anne Royall famously secured an exclusive interview by sitting on his clothes until he agreed to speak with her.

**William Howard Taft (1909-1913)** consumed a massive 12-ounce steak every morning at exactly 8:30 a.m., accompanied by buttered toast, two oranges, and coffee with cream and sugar. The 340-pound president specifically avoided eggs and maintained this carnivorous breakfast routine throughout his presidency.

**Calvin Coolidge (1923-1929)** had White House staff rub petroleum jelly all over his head during breakfast, supposedly to manage his hair and ease sinus problems. This peculiar ritual occurred after his standard 11-hour sleep and continued for his entire six-year presidency.

**Harry S. Truman (1945-1953)** began each day with a shot of Old Grand-Dad bourbon—doctor's orders, he claimed—followed by orange juice. He'd then take a brisk 10-block walk before breakfast, despite his wife Bess's vocal disapproval of the morning alcohol consumption.

**Bill Clinton (1993-2001)** turned his morning jogs into impromptu McDonald's runs, regularly stopping mid-workout to buy breakfast sandwiches and fries. These unexpected visits often surprised diners who found themselves face-to-face with the jogging president.

## Why It Matters

These unusual routines matter because they humanize figures often viewed through the lens of history books and formal portraits. Presidential morning habits reveal the personal quirks, health beliefs, and lifestyle choices that shaped how these leaders approached their demanding roles.

These stories also highlight how presidential privacy and public expectations have evolved. Adams' naked swimming would trigger a media frenzy today, while Truman's morning bourbon shot would raise serious questions about fitness for office. The anecdotes show how differently Americans once viewed their presidents' personal lives.

Moreover, these habits often reflected the medical understanding and social norms of their respective eras. Coolidge's petroleum jelly treatments align with early 20th-century grooming practices, while Truman's medicinal bourbon consumption reflects Depression-era folk remedies that doctors sometimes endorsed.

## Background

Presidential morning routines have always fascinated historians because they offer insights into leadership styles and personal discipline. The presidency's demanding schedule makes morning routines particularly significant—how presidents start their day often determines their effectiveness in handling national crises.

These five presidents span nearly two centuries of American history, from the early republic through the modern era. Their routines reflect changing American attitudes toward health, privacy, and presidential behavior. Adams' routine emerged from Puritan work ethic traditions, while Clinton's McDonald's stops reflected 1990s casual culture.

The documentation of these habits comes from various sources: White House staff memoirs, presidential diaries, newspaper accounts, and family records. The Anne Royall interview with Adams, for instance, was widely reported in 1820s newspapers and became part of Washington political folklore.

## What's Next

While modern presidents maintain more conventional morning routines—typically involving classified briefings, exercise, and family time—the tradition of presidential quirks continues. The difference lies in media scrutiny and security protocols that now govern every aspect of presidential life.

These historical routines serve as reminders that effective leadership often comes with personal eccentricities. They also highlight how our expectations of presidential behavior have become more standardized, perhaps at the cost of the colorful personalities that once defined the office.

Future presidential historians will likely find equally fascinating morning habits among modern presidents, though increased security and media attention make such revelations less likely to emerge until decades later.
