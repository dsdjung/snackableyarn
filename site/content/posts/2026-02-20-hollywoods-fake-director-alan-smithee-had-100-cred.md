## What Happened: The Secret Life of Hollywood's Fake Director

Alan Smithee wasn't just any made-up name—he was an official Hollywood institution. From 1968 to 2000, the Directors Guild of America (DGA) maintained this pseudonym as a last resort for directors whose films had been butchered beyond recognition by studios or producers.

The system worked like a witness protection program for creative professionals. Directors had to prove to a DGA panel that their artistic vision had been completely compromised—whether through unauthorized re-editing, studio interference, or loss of final cut privileges. If approved, they could remove their real name and replace it with "Alan Smithee," but they were sworn to secrecy about using the pseudonym.

Over three decades, Smithee accumulated an impressive filmography spanning genres from action thrillers to TV movies. His "career" included everything from big-budget disasters to low-budget horror films, making him arguably one of the most experienced directors in Hollywood history—despite never setting foot on a set.

## Why It Matters: When Creative Control Goes to War

The Alan Smithee phenomenon reveals the ongoing tension between artistic vision and commercial demands in Hollywood. For directors, having their name attached to a film they can no longer recognize represents both professional embarrassment and potential career damage. The pseudonym offered a way to preserve their reputation while acknowledging the reality of studio interference.

This wasn't just about ego—directors' reputations directly impact their ability to secure future projects and negotiate creative control. A string of poorly received films can end a career, even if the director wasn't responsible for the final product. The Smithee system acknowledged that sometimes, the best career move is strategic anonymity.

The practice also highlighted how common studio interference actually was. With over 100 Smithee credits accumulated over 30 years, it became clear that directors losing creative control wasn't an occasional occurrence—it was a systemic issue in Hollywood's power structure.

## Background: From Gunfighter to Guild Policy

The Alan Smithee tradition began with "Death of a Gunfighter" in 1969, though the groundwork was laid a year earlier. The film had been directed by two different people—Robert Totten and Don Siegel—after creative conflicts led to Totten's replacement mid-production. When neither director wanted credit for the final cut, the DGA needed a solution.

The guild chose "Alan Smithee" because it sounded like a plausible director's name and was an anagram of "The Alias Men." The pseudonym had to be generic enough to not draw attention while being distinctive enough to serve its legal purpose in contracts and credits.

Richard Widmark, the star of "Death of a Gunfighter," reportedly played a role in the naming process, though the exact details remain part of Hollywood lore. What's certain is that the DGA formalized the system, creating specific procedures for directors to petition for pseudonym use.

The secrecy requirement was crucial—if directors openly discussed using Alan Smithee, it would defeat the purpose of protecting their reputations. This created a strange situation where Hollywood's worst-kept secret was also its most officially protected one.

## The Ultimate Meta Disaster

The Alan Smithee system met its end through the most ironic twist imaginable. In 1997, writer Joe Eszterhas created "An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn," a comedy specifically mocking the pseudonym tradition. The film followed a director named Alan Smithee (played by Eric Idle) who couldn't use the pseudonym because it was his real name.

Director Arthur Hiller took on the project, presumably confident that a film about Hollywood's creative control issues would maintain some level of quality. Instead, the movie became such a disaster that Hiller himself wanted to disown it. In the ultimate act of meta-commentary, he petitioned the DGA to remove his name from the film he'd made about directors removing their names from films.

The guild approved Hiller's request, meaning "An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn" was officially credited to Alan Smithee. The movie grossed just $59,921 against its $10 million budget, making it one of the biggest box office bombs in history. The irony was so perfect that it broke the system entirely.

## What's Next: The Post-Smithee Era

Faced with a pseudonym that had become a punchline, the DGA retired Alan Smithee in 2000. The guild now handles disownment requests on a case-by-case basis, creating unique pseudonyms for each situation rather than using a universal alias.

This change reflects Hollywood's evolution toward greater transparency about creative processes. While studio interference hasn't disappeared, the industry has become more open about discussing creative conflicts and directorial vision. Streaming platforms and independent production companies have also shifted power dynamics, giving directors more options for maintaining creative control.

The Alan Smithee legacy lives on in film schools and Hollywood lore as a reminder of the eternal tension between commerce and art. His "filmography" remains a fascinating catalog of movies that, for various reasons, their creators preferred to forget.

Modern audiences can still spot Alan Smithee credits in older films and TV shows, each one representing a small Hollywood tragedy—a director's vision lost to the machinery of commercial entertainment. In a town built on dreams and storytelling, sometimes the most interesting story is the one about the storyteller who never was.
